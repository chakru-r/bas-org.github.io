## Opinionated Guide to Buying Telescopes
Karthik Subramanian, karthik !remove spaces! 301176 !+! bas !AT! gmail !DOT! com

The objective of this article is to provide the **first-time telescope buyer** with
the *minimum information needed to ask the right questions* before investing in
a telescope.

Please note that this article only covers equipment for visual observation.
It does *not* cover equipment for astrophotography.

If you've already made up your mind that you want to buy a telescope, then jump
straight to the [Vendor Information][4] page. If not, read on.

This guide by itself is probably not enough to help you buy a telescope; but it
should definitely help you get started. It is necessarily short on many details.
Like its title implies, it makes many assertions without proof, or even
evidence. If you find that you have questions, please do ask on the [BAS google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/b-a-s).
In addition, [Star Ware][1] is a good resource on this topic.

No originality of content is claimed, except perhaps for the presentation.

### Don't Buy A Telescope ...
... not just yet, anyway.

A quality telescope is an expensive instrument. Should you choose to buy a
telescope and decide later that amateur astronomy is not for you, you're stuck
with the scope until you find someone who will buy it from you.

Many beginners approach a telescope with very high expectations. No matter how
expensive the telescope is, it cannot do certain things.

For one, what you see at the eyepiece will *not* be anything like the colourful
photographs you see taken from the Hubble Space Telescope. In fact, most of what
you see at the eyepiece will be images in varying shades of grey. This isn't
really the telescope's fault; the human eye cannot perceive colour in very dim
images. Cameras can, however - but that's the subject of another discussion. 

For another, your telescope will likely *not* show you the massive images of the
planets that you're used to seeing in photographs. Jupiter will probably appear
smaller than a single whole piece of black pepper.

So what *can* you see through a telescope? [This site][9] gives a good idea of
what to expect at the eyepiece.

A word of caution: the sketches in the link above show you views that *can* be
achieved with a telescope. The views are real, other people besides the original
sketcher(s) have seen them, /and/ documented them. However, please do keep in
mind that it takes a lot of practice to actually achieve these views.

Inspired by the sketches, you might take your newly-acquired scope to your
rooftop and hunt for say, the Andromeda Galaxy. In all probability, you will see
just a grey blob. Many factors affect the view in your telescope - some, like
the equipment, and its care, are in our control. Others, like dark skies (or the
lack thereof), or the weather, are not entirely so.

**Please try and look through a telescope or two, to appreciate what you're
getting into before you put down your money. One way of doing this is to attend
star parties. Another is to just sync up with your friendly neighbourhood BAS
member, most (if not all) of us will be happy to show you our telescopes.**

#### Binoculars
If you really want to buy something right away, consider buying a good pair of
binoculars. Why binoculars?

+ Binoculars are a useful astronomical instrument in their own right. Most
  experienced amateurs usually have a pair of binoculars, and with good reason.
  See [Rony de Laet's page][11] for examples of what is possible with binoculars.
+ Binoculars are relatively inexpensive as compared to a telescope.
+ Binoculars are multipurpose. Should you decide that amateur astronomy is
  not for you, chances are that you will still not regret your binocular
  purchase, and will continue to use them in other pursuits.

[This page][2] has more to say about binoculars.

### Buying a Telescope
It is usually a good idea to get familiar with some telescope terms, and what
they mean, before buying a telescope. The [Telescope Terminology][3] page should
help. The rest of this guide assumes that you are familiar with at least some
telescope terminology.

#### Some General Remarks
More aperture is a good thing to have. With more aperture comes more
light-gathering capability, brighter images, and the ability to resolve finer
details. More aperture also brings with it more bulk and weight.

Longer focal lengths yield a smaller field of view. Shorter focal lengths give a
wider field of view. Longer focal lengths also result in a longer telescope,
except in the case of Maksutov- and Schmidt-Cassegrain telescopes.

When budgeting for a telescope, keep in mind that you might also need to buy a
few accessories. The minimum setup you need is a telescope OTA, a finder scope,
a mount, and one or more eyepieces. Depending on the telescope, you might also
need a star diagonal. Most beginner telescope packages contain all of the above,
in which case you *probably* do not need to buy anything more.

#### To Ponder Before Buying

##### Disclaimers
+ The prices mentioned below are current as on the time of writing (Nov 2015).

+ The prices mentioned below are necessarily approximate, and are meant to give
  the reader a **rough** idea of the cost. Please contact your vendor for
  up-to-date and accurate pricing information.

+ The ultimate buying decision is that of the buyer. Please do not take the
  recommendations below at face value - instead, use them (and this guide) as an
  aid to do your homework before arriving at a buying decision.

##### Budget
+ If budget is your limiting consideration, then the buckets of your interest are
  roughly Rs. 13K, and Rs. 23K. If your budget is smaller than Rs. 13K, *and* you
  do not already possess a pair of binoculars, you are encouraged to read the
  [binocular page][2].

+ A budget of around Rs. 13000  will fetch you a 70mm Equatorially mounted
  refractor. In the same bucket, you might be able to find a 70mm Alt-Az
  refractor for a little less, or an 80mm Alt-Az mounted wide-field refractor
  for a little more.

+ If you're willing to stretch your budget roughly twofold, a good "middle path"
  choice would be a 6" Dobsonian telescope. This should typically set you back by
  around Rs. 23000.

##### Size, Weight & Portability
+ As a rule of thumb, **do not** buy a refractor with optics sized smaller than
  70mm. You *will* read that any telescope is a worthwhile investment, even if
  it's "just" a 50mm refractor. This statement is true. The trouble with smaller
  (and cheaper) telescopes is that they are usually a marriage of decent optics
  with useless mounts. Thus, it takes *some* experience to extract goodness out
  of these telescopes; this can be a frustrating experience for a beginner.

+ In a similar vein, avoid reflectors sized smaller than 4.5" (114mm).

+ The ideal starter scope according to many is a 6" Dob. This is indeed a good
  recommendation. Before you go ahead and buy a Dob, please try and see one for
  yourself. A person of typical build should have no trouble in carrying a 6"
  Dob, in two pieces at the most. However, you should verify that this will
  indeed work for you before investing in a Dob. If portability is your
  overarching concern, you might want to consider a small (5" or thereabouts)
  Mak or SCT.

+ "Starter" mounts are usually underprovisioned. Buying a well-provisioned mount
  will let you buy a second (bigger) telescope in the future without having to buy
  a mount for it. (Assuming that you do not want to use both telescopes
  simultaneously.) It goes without saying that a good mount will also inflate your
  budget. It will also be a rather heavy piece of metal.

+ GoTo mounts are capable of providing *some* of the conveniences of an
  equatorial mount, without weighing as much. Most of them work with reasonable
  accuracy after being aligned. Note that GoTo mounts need power, either in the
  form of batteries, or AC. Some will *not* work at all without power.

##### Use/Interest
+ All telescopes do not perform equally well on all kinds of targets. Broadly, one
  could speak of *Planetary Observation* and *Deep-Sky Observation*.

+ Long focal lengths are suited for Planetary targets, since the narrow FOV
  (and high magnifications) will work well to show details on the Moon and Planets.
  This is also good on Double Stars.

+ Short focal lengths give a wide field of view, and are suited for Deep-Sky
  targets.

+ Here too, a good "middle path" choice is a 6" Reflector. Most available 6" Dobs
  seem to be figured at f/8 or thereabouts, making them slightly on the longer
  side.

##### Maintenance
+ Refractors need the least maintenance.

+ Reflectors need to be collimated fairly often. Collimation is a simple
  procedure, however, and is nothing to be afraid of. A badly collimated reflector
  will perform badly.

+ Short-tube reflectors with spherical mirrors and a corrector (Barlow) built into
  the focuser (the Bird-Jones or Jones-Bird design) are difficult to collimate.
  You can recognize them by comparing the stated focal length of the telescope to
  the physical length of its tube. If the tube length is a *lot* lesser than the
  focal length, the scope is a Jones-Bird. **Note:** There is nothing inherently
  wrong with the Jones-Bird design; it is just that most low-end scopes using this
  design are badly done. See References [5][5] and [6][6] for more details.

+ Maks and SCTs usually do not need to be collimated in the field. Collimating a Mak
  is more difficult than collimating a Newtonian reflector.

##### Accessories
+ Collimation Tools

  Newtonian reflectors need collimation every now and then. Most reflectors come
  with a collimation cap, which should be sufficient to perform satisfactory
  collimation. More expensive collimation tools like Laser Collimators and
  Barlowed Lasers are available as well.

+ Cleaning Tools

  For most purposes, an air blower (of the photographic kind) and a *soft*
  camel-hair brush should do. Do make sure to perform the "cheek test" on the
  brush - poking at your cheek with the brush should not cause any bristly
  feeling. If it's soft enough for your cheek, it's OK to use it on your mirror as
  well.

  More complicated cleaning might be needed on an infrequent basis. This is
  detailed elsewhere.

##### Avoid
+ Buying "Toy-Store" telescopes which are marketed solely on the basis of
  their magnification. In other literature, these are also known as
  "Department-Store Telescopes". 

+ Trusting reviews that do not explain why (or why not) a telescope is "good" or otherwise.

+ Telescopes with a focuser barrel size other than 1.25" or 2".
  0.965" Eyepieces are hard to come by.

+ 45-degree diagonals. They're good for terrestrial viewing, but are uncomfortable
  for astronomy.

#### Vendor References
Please consult the [Vendor Information][4] page.

#### Post-Buying Checks
+ Check the OTA for scratches and dents.

+ Check to see that the mirror (or lenses, as the case may be) is reasonably
  clean, and doesn't have any visible spots or scratches.

+ Check that the mount is working fine, and slews smoothly.

+ (This test applies to any tripod-mounted telescope).
  Focus on any object of your choice. Rap the mount near the OTA (or the tube
  rings) with your knuckles - not very hard, but with just enough force to make
  the view in the eyepiece shake. (This shouldn't be too difficult). Count the
  seconds until the view in the eyepiece settles down. A settling time of
  3-5 seconds is good; anything more than 10 seconds is not. If your scope
  takes too long to recover from vibrations, you might have to do something to
  make the mount more steady.

+ **The Star Test** The idea behind the star test is to focus the telescope
  on a bright star using reasonably high magnification. Then, adjust the focus
  inwards until the star is *out of focus* - you should see a pattern of
  concentric rings. Adjust the focus outwards, until the star is out of focus
  again. You should see exactly the same pattern of concentric rings as before.
  If not, your scope needs collimation.

  The star test is detailed more comprehensively in [Star Ware][1], and also
  in Gary Seronik's [No-Tools Telescope Collimation][12].

  Freshly-unpacked Refractors and Catadioptrics should **not** need collimation.
  The best thing to do in such a case is to return the scope.

+ If you bought a reflector, and the primary mirror is not centre-dotted, then
  you might want to do this. Centre-dotted mirrors are easier to collimate than
  the ones without. A good reference for centre-dotting is [8][8].

#### I already have a scope from the "avoid" list
No harm done. If you are satisfied with your purchase, and are able to use it
well, skip this section. If not, read on - it might be possible to salvage
the situation.

+ *I bought/was gifted a small (50mm/60mm) refractor by a well intentioned
   friend/relative. It shakes like crazy and I can't seem to find anything
   in the sky apart from the moon*. 

   **Don't throw it away!**. Not just yet, anyway. Small (and cheap) refractors,
   as mentioned earlier, are *usually* not a bad deal, except for the mount.
   This is especially true of the lower-end Celestrons and the like. Typically,
   the tripod/mount that these telescopes come with are light and flimsy. In some
   cases, it is possible to make the tripod/mount more stable by counterweighting
   the tripod. It is also possible to make use of pieces of teflon sheeting to
   smoothen the motion of the mount head.

   If your refractor shows interesting colours of the rainbow on the moon,
   and you're not really able to see the moon except as a blob (albeit a blob with
   *some* features) then the optics are probably made of plastic, or low grade
   glass. This is usually the case with Toy-Store scopes. They are usually a bad
   deal.

+ *I bought/was gifted a low-end Jones-Bird reflector that doesn't work well*

  The most popular Jones-Bird reflector in this location seems to be the Celestron
  AstroMaster 114.

  The primary complaint with a low-end Jones-Bird is usually that the images are
  "soft", and it is impossible to bring the instrument to focus. This could be
  caused by either of two reasons:

  - The instrument is out of collimation (and is difficult to collimate), or,

  - It refuses to come to focus, regardless of the state of its collimation.
    This usually happens because of a badly positioned corrector, or a bad
    corrector.

  Another complaint could be that the image is blurry throughout the range of
  the focuser. For instance, the moon remains a white blob, and it is impossible
  to resolve any details - even craters - on its surface.

  Some background is available in [Reference 6][6].

  To troubleshoot:

  1. Check that it is possible to unscrew (or otherwise remove) either the
     corrector alone, *or* the focuser along with the corrector from the OTA.

     Sometimes the corrector is secured by it being glued in place. This *could*
     make it impossible to remove the focuser/corrector without risk of damaging
     either.

     If this is the case, the best thing you can do is to try and collimate the
     scope with the corrector in place. This, as we have already seen, is fairly
     difficult to do. You might want to try using a laser collimator if you can
     get hold of one.

  2. If it is possible to remove the corrector, please try and remember if you
     removed the focuser/corrector at any time in the past. If you did so, and
     inadvertently reversed the corrector, the telescope will not come to focus.

  3. Remove the corrector. Check the state of the telescope's collimation.
     If it is out of collimation, try and collimate it. See either [Star Ware][1]
     or Gary Seronik's [Beginner's Guide to Collimation][7] for simple collimation
     instructions.

  4. Replace the corrector, and see if you can now achieve focus. If not, try
     reversing the corrector and check again. If this works, you are good to go.
     If it is not possible to reverse the corrector, then your best bet is to
     return the telescope to the seller.

  5. If, after performing all of the above steps, the views in your Jones-Bird
     are no better than before, then you should return the telescope.

If you still have questions, please feel free to post on the BAS Google Group.
