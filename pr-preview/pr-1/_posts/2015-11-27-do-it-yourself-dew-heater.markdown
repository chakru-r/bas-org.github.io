## A Do-It-Yourself Dew Heater (Courtesy Sanath)

### The Problem
At low temperatures (say, as low as it gets on a winter night at the typical
observing site *near* Bangalore), if the air is humid enough, the moisture
condenses on any exposed surface, including mirrors, corrector plates, and
objective lenses.

This is the dew problem. Its primary effect is that it can derail your observing
session by giving the proceedings a foggy appearance.

That apart, the dew also exposes you to the problem of accumulating sticky dust
on your telescope optics - especially if there are trees around your observing
site.

Prevention is better than cure, and this is true of dew as well.


### Dew Shields
Since dew only forms on exposed surfaces, one solution is to shield them.  This
can be done by having a long enough shade, or *dew shield* extending from the
objective end of the tube. This applies primarily to Refractors and Maks.

This [Sky & Telescope article][2] has more to say about dew shields, including
how to make your own. If you're looking for foam rubber (as mentioned in the
article), all that you need to do is to get hold of a Yoga Mat.

Sanath's [article on dew heaters][1] has references to sources for other things
you might need, like Velcro strips.

Per a discussion with Sathya, the formula for the length of the dew shield is
1.5 x D + 50mm, where D is the telescope aperture in mm.  Sathya also recommends
using corrugated cardboard reinforced by a covering of duct-tape instead of a
rubber mat.

### Dew Heaters
Dew Shields are the first line of defence against dew. Sometimes it is cold
enough for dew to form despite dew shields. What you then need is a dew heater.
Think of it as a dew shield with a built-in heating mechanism.

Dew Heaters work by maintaining the temperature around the objective (and hence
that of the objective as well) above the dew point. While commercial dew heaters
are available, it is not too difficult to make your own.

Sanath has written up plans [to make your own dew heater][1]. It also comes with
vendor/shopping references in Bangalore for the parts involved.

A [discussion on the BAS google group][3] might also make for interesting reading.
